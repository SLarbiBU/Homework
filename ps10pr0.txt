Sometime when I’m just beginning to research something I read a whole bunch of different articles and visit multiple websites on the topic until I find the few that I choose to use. Later, however, I sometimes need to refer back to something I read that I hadn’t anticipated needing, and it’s always difficult to find. Having this readily available to me would eliminate a lot of the issue.
