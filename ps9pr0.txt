Telling a computer to Ôopen the bag,Õ is ambiguous, it leaves the question of how. Humans, on the other hand, are much more intuitive, they know how the bag is meant to be opened.  A similarity between humans and computers however, is that although humans do not need it, they still operate better with more instruction. The more specific somebody is when explaining to a human how to do something, the better the human will perform the task, this is the same with computers.IÕm not sure if machines like NELL will ever reach a point where they will be able to overcome this obstacle, at least not until humans can.  Essentially we are attempting to teach a machine human language, and the obstacles the computer faces are very similar to the obstacles humans face when learning another language. Idioms, homonyms, and different figures of speech often befuddle humans, and I foresee that this will continue to be an obstacle for both humans and computers.
