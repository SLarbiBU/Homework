In the case of the banking article, it showed that the models were generally helpful; although, the other part of the time they can lead to unprepared for catastrophe. With the case of greenhouse gases, I think that they provide us with something to go off of, but are making people paranoid about human extinction due to uneducated interpretations of computations.2. I think that anything that relies on human action/decision-making in any capacity is impossible to predict. Humans are inherently unpredictable and there isn’t a behavior-norm that can be really mapped out. Therefore, any computations dealing with unpredictability is bound to have error.
